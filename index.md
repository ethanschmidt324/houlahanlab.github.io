## Highlights

{% capture text %}

The molecular profiles of tumours vary from individual to individual which makes effectively treating cancer challenging. The Houlahan Lab integrates state-of-the-art computational tools with large-scale tumour multi-omic data to uncover the impact of inherited DNA variants on cancer predisposition and progression. Inherited variants that modulate tumourigenesis may serve as powerful blood-based biomarkers for improved cancer screening and prognosis.
