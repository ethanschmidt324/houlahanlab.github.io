The Houlahan Lab is now supported by the Bright Run Foundation (see [here](https://brightrun.ca/2025/08/09/re-purposing-clinical-sequencing-data-for-broader-breast-cancer-susceptibly-profiling/) for more details). To give back, we participated in the 5km run through Christie Lake Conservation Area. In collaboration with the Daniel lab, we raised over $15,000 for breast cancer research!
